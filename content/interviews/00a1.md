## Transcript

**SARAH SCHULMAN: Let’s just start, for informational purposes, with you saying the name, the date, the address of where we are, and how old you are.**

ROBERT VAZQUEZ: My name is Robert Vazquez-Pacheco. Today is December 14th, 2002, and I am forty-six years old. We are in my apartment at 327 St. Nicholas Avenue, which is in Harlem.

**SS: Thank you, Robert. My first question is, do you remember the first time you heard the word “AIDS?”**

RV: I’m trying to think. I don’t remember the first time I heard it. It might have been in 1981. But I remember reading The New York Times article in Jones Beach. I was in Jones Beach with my boyfriend, and we had taken the Sunday Times. In perusing the Times, we read that article about the cases of the five — I think it was five — men in San Francisco, or something like that. That is my clearest memory of that.

**SS: So, who were you that day?**

RV: Who was I that day? Let’s see, I was what — twenty-four or twenty-five years old. I was with my boyfriend, Jeff. We were living on the Upper West Side, before it became chic. Where was I working? I was working for a lighting design company. I was studying lighting design.

**SS: And you guys were living together?**

RV: We were living together.

**SS: Did you think that was the love of your life, and that this was —**

RV: Yeah. Yeah. We were together for six years, until he died. He was diagnosed with KS in 1981, in September.

**SS: So how much time passed between that day and Jones Beach?**

RV: Months. It was in July, because it was July 4th weekend that the article came out. His birthday was in September of that year. I think it was 1981 when the article came out, so — what? July, August, September, three months.

**SS: And had you known anybody else in those three months that —**

RV: We had heard stuff about, you know, people being sick. I remember in 1980 we had started to hear stuff. Of course, in New York it was like, “Oh, those sluts in San Francisco are getting some disease.” So that’s what we had heard. So, there were vague stories about it, and no one really knew anything.

**SS: So, the first person you knew who had AIDS was your lover.**

RV: Yeah.

**SS: Wow.**

RV: Yeah. He was diagnosed — it was amazing. He was diagnosed on September 9th, 1981. I remember it because it was his thirtieth birthday. His doctor called him in to tell him the results of the tests. I had organized a surprise birthday party for him. He called me at my job and he said, “My doctor called and told me to meet him at his office at New York Hospital. So, can you come meet me at the hospital?” So, I went to meet him at the hospital. He was coming out of his doctor’s office when I got there.

**SS: So, when he went into the doctor, did you guys sort of know what was going to happen?**

RV: We knew something was wrong with him, because he had a couple of lesions. And they had found some lesions, I think, internally. But nobody knew what it was.

**SS: So, what did the doctor say to you?**

RV: Then the doctor said that he had this cancer. Then as time passed, we learned that it was GRID that turned into AIDS. But I remember, the old New York Hospital had this huge lobby. I don’t know if you remember New York Hospital had a beautiful art deco lobby, a big lobby that you walked into in the hospital. It looked like a hotel or a train station. I remember he came down in the elevators and I saw him. He started sobbing when he saw me, and we sat down on a bench. I grabbed him and I was holding him, and then I had to run to the telephone to call my friend to say, “Call everybody, the surprise party is off.” Because people were getting ready to show up later. I was supposed to take him out and hang out, and people were going to show up at our apartment later. So, I had to call up a good friend of mine and say, “Call everybody to say ‘no surprise party.’”

**SS: So how did you guys proceed? What were his treatments?**

RV: He went on chemo not too long after that. Jeff was a nice Jewish boy from Queens. He grew up in Long Island City. His family lived in Queens. His family was fairly traditional, so they were all freaked out about the fact that he had a Puerto Rican boyfriend to begin with. I don’t know, I think we just sort of negotiated. We didn’t know what was happening, so we just sort of negotiated it day by day. He and I had only been together for about six months before he found out that he had KS. He said to me, “Do you want to leave? Do you want to end the relationship? I don’t know what’s going to happen.” I was twenty-five, I think. I said, “No, of course not.” He worked. He was able to work. He died in 1986. He was able to keep working. I mean, he got progressively sicker. We lived in a fifth-floor walk-up on the Upper West Side, and he would do things like bike to work. He would exercise and stuff. But as time passed, he just got more and more ill. I don’t know. First of all, it was such a long time ago. We got along really well.

**SS: Did you guys hook up with other people who had AIDS?**

RV: I think we bumped into someone, like in the mid-1980s, at a party, that then Jeff developed a relationship with. There weren’t a lot of people. In the early-1980s, there weren’t a lot of people that we knew in our circle of friends that knew about it. Everybody was sort of worried and scared, and we started to hear the stories about people getting sick and dying. But we didn’t see a lot. We started to slowly sort of socially meet people. He wasn’t meeting anyone, like at the doctor’s office or anything. And this was way before anything like support groups, or anything like that.

**SS: So, when did you first see that there were starting to be organized groups of people with AIDS, or people talking about AIDS in an organized way, or getting medication?**

RV: I think it was probably in the late-1980s. We were starting to see more people in 1984, 1985, if I recall. We used to both work on the Gay Switchboard. I think we were both on the Board, and I used to do the trainings with them. Now it’s the GLBT Switchboard of New York, or whatever. But we used to work there, so I remember sort of beginning to incorporate a curriculum of basic AIDS information into the information that we had at the switchboard.

**: And how was he getting treatment information?**

RV: He actually wasn’t getting — there was no treatment information out there. He was dependent on his doctor, who was giving him whatever the treatment was. I don’t even remember what the treatment was, the chemo was, at that time. That was it. We really didn’t know anyone that was out there that was doing any kind of treatment activism, or advocacy, or education. None of that stuff existed.

**SS: Did you hook up with GMHC at all?**

RV: I’m trying to remember when GMHC started. I think he tried in the beginning, early on in GMHC. He called them. They never called him back. He called them again and they never called him back. After that, he just let it go.

**SS: How did you deal in terms of yourself? Did you feel that you might be infected at that time?**

RV: I sort of figured I was. I had an assumption. This was in the days before the antibody test. I realized that I had had swollen lymph nodes since 1980, or something like that. So, in sort of going back, I probably remember about the time I got infected. It wasn’t Jeff. Who knows who it was. It was the late-1970s.

**SS: How do you know?**

RV: How do I know?

**SS: That that’s when you got infected?**

RV: Simply because looking at the symptoms, about the flu-like stuff. And I remember getting one day, having a flu that wasn’t a flu that I stayed home from work for. I remember there was a lot of drama for me staying home from work, because I was out of work for about three days. But I wasn’t necessarily running a high fever, but I was feeling sick. So, in hindsight now I’m thinking that that might have been it, in 1980, sort of in the fall.

**SS: So here you are, this really young guy. You’re in your late twenties. Your lover is extremely sick. You’re worried about yourself. Where’s your support system? Your families?**

RV: My family, my friends, that was my support system. I didn’t go to any organizations, or anything like that. So, it was basically family and friends who were my support system. And my family was great. My family was really great, so they were very accepting.

**SS: And Jeff’s family?**

RV: Jeff’s family was a different story. I’ll give an example. His sister and my sister were pregnant around the same time. When they gave birth, he and I went to the hospital to see my sister. My sister gave birth first. We went to see my sister in the hospital. We walked into the hospital room. My sister was there and she had my nephew there. This was maybe 1984, I think. She said to Jeff, “Here, hold the baby.” And this was in 1984, when people were still sort of trying to figure out what infection was and everything else. They knew he was sick, but my sister was like, “Here, you’re a member of the family. Hold the baby.” So, he was holding the baby and playing with Christopher. When his sister gave birth, she never let him touch the baby. That was a big bone of contention. That really hurt him and that made him draw away from his family. So, my family was much more — he was very much a member of the family. For example, he was expected to participate in all the family events. It was like, “If it’s Christmas you show up with Christmas gifts. We don’t care if you’re Jewish. You’re coming. You’re participating in this.” So, he was part of the family, whereas his family didn’t really want to have anything to do with me at all.

**SS: So, what happened when he had his first hospitalization?**

RV: It was rough. They also didn’t want to learn anything, which was sort of scary. One of the things I did with my family was I sat down with everyone and I told them, “Okay, this is what we know. This is the information I have.” I said, “Jeff, sit down with your mother and father and tell them this.” They didn’t want to hear it. They really didn’t want to hear it. They were frightened, I’m assuming now. So, in his first hospitalization, his mother just went hysterical. She was like, “I don’t know what to do.” I was like, “Relax, calm down.”

**SS: So, you were taking care of them and him?**

RV: Well, to the extent that I could. She was very resentful of me. She would — it’s very funny. She would visit Jeff during the week, or sometimes she would just stop by. She was used to being able to go to his apartment and she would clean his apartment. I moved into his apartment. She would clean his apartment, and after I moved in and we were together I said, “Tell your mother not to come and clean the apartment, alright? You and I can clean the apartment. It’s okay.” So, he was very close to his mother. But when his parents would come to visit sometimes, they would come in from Queens and they would take him out to dinner. So, they would come to our apartment, hang out for a little, and then go out to dinner. I never went on those with them. But she would come in and she would clean the bathroom while she was there. One day I went into the bathroom and found toilet paper stuck to the walls, because she was cleaning the bathroom with toilet paper.
