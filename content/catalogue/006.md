Co-founded by Latina/o Caucus member and longtime media and entertainment producer Gonzalo Aburto, Homovisiones was the first Latinx LGBTQ show on cable access in the U.S.  It first aired on community access television in 1994 and ran for 10 years, documenting news, entertainment and pressing issues affecting the Latino communities.  ACT UP Latina/o Caucus members were both behind and in front of the camera, hosting segments or having their actions and organizing efforts featured.
