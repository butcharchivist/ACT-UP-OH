The Spanish Language Committee preceded the Latina/o Caucus and was the first working group of ACT UP NY that convened Spanish speaking members.  Its main purpose was to translate the materials that ACT UP was producing, particularly news and advocacy about treatment and political issues.  After a while, members of the Spanish Language Committee felt that the issues facing Latino people in NYC were not being voiced nor prioritized by the organization at-large.  This sentiment led to a more intentional approach to LatInx issues through the convening of the Latina/o Caucus.
