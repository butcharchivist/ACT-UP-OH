ACT UP Americas was a working group that focused on advocating for HIV/AIDS issues throughout the Western Hemisphere.  As HIV/AIDS infections increased in the Americas, Latina/o Caucus members felt the need to educate on and advocate for what was happening beyond the U.S. borders.  Several members had ties to LGBTQ and HIV organizations throughout the continent, which they used to develop a network of transnational activism.  ACT UP Americas took the reigns of the Latina/o Caucus's advocacy against the Argentine government for the legal recognition of Comunidad Homosexual Argentina (CHA) and published an ACT UP Americas newsletter that was disseminated throughout the hemisphere.  Notably, the group organized a humanitarian AIDS medicine recycling program (AID for AIDS) that delivered unused medication to HIV positive people in Venezuela, Peru and other countries.
